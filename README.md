# Pacman_using_robots

The file utilizes micropython to allow control via UART of a 3pi+ Pololu robot. Importantly, you must have the micropython file uploaded to the 3pi+.
It assumes you have three ultrasonic sensors along with a bluetooth module.

Micropython file to upload to the pololu can be found here: https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86/5.1
Again, it is needed for you to use this file.
